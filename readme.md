# Django React Test

This is a experimental project for react and redux with django. 


# Architecture

Basically, django as a pure `api server` (backend). Frontend is responsible for i18n, url router, and server render.


### Frontend

We use the following techniques.

 - postcss
 - react
 - redux
 - express
 - babel
 
 
some devtools
 
 - webpack dev middleware
 - webpack hot middleware
 - redux dev tools

pip install -r requirements.txt # for prod
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt # for development

npm install
npm install -g concurrently
```
